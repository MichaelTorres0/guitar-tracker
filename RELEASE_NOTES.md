# v2.1.2 - Complete All Tasks Button & Test Fixes

**Release Date:** January 2026

## Summary

This patch release fixes the "Complete Daily Tasks" button functionality and resolves critical test infrastructure issues. All 63 tests now pass.

## Bug Fixes

### Complete All Tasks Button Fix
- **Fixed:** The "Complete Daily Tasks" button (`quickActionJustPlayed()`) was looking for `.btn-just-played` class which no longer existed
- **Solution:** Updated button selector to use `#quickCompleteDaily` ID or `.btn-quick-action` class
- **Added:** Null check to prevent errors if button element is not found

### localStorage Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Fixed:** localStorage operations failed in Node.js test environment due to ES module scope issues
- **Solution:** Created new `localStorage.js` helper module that provides a cross-platform localStorage API
- **Impact:** All modules now import `ls` from `localStorage.js` instead of accessing `localStorage` directly

### Test Setup Fix
- **Fixed:** `test-setup.js` was overwriting `globalThis.localStorage` with JSDOM's undefined localStorage
- **Solution:** Removed the localStorage overwrite line, keeping the test file's mock in place

### CSS Print Styles Update
- **Fixed:** Print styles still referenced old `.btn-just-played` class
- **Solution:** Updated to use `.btn-quick-action` and `.btn-timer` classes

# v2.1.1 - Test Infrastructure Fixes

**Release Date:** January 2026

## Summary

This patch release fixes critical issues with the test infrastructure that prevented tests from running in Node.js environments. The core application functionality is unchanged.

## Bug Fixes

### Test Environment Compatibility
- **Fixed:** Module-level `window` assignments causing `ReferenceError: window is not defined` in Node.js
- **Affected files:** `ui.js`, `sessions.js`, `onboarding.js`, `stringHistory.js`
- **Solution:** Wrapped all window assignments with `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')` checks

### Humidity Display Fix
- **Fixed:** Null temperature values displaying as `null°F` in humidity log table
- **Solution:** Added null check with fallback to em-dash (`—`) for missing temperature values

### Test Setup Improvements
- **Fixed:** Test modules loading before global DOM environment was configured
- **Solution:** Converted `test-setup.js` to use dynamic imports, ensuring globals are set first
- **Added:** LocalStorage mock for reliable test execution

## Technical Details

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Files Modified | 6 |
| Tests Passing | 48/62 |
| Breaking Changes | None |

# v2.0 - Major Feature Release

## Overview

Major update implementing 7 enhancements across 3 development sprints. This release transforms the first-time user experience, adds comprehensive data tracking, and provides intelligent insights for guitar maintenance.

**Release Date:** January 2026
**Version:** 2.0.0
**Total Enhancements:** 7
**New Modules:** 3 (onboarding.js, sessions.js, stringHistory.js)
**Lines Added:** ~1,147

---

## 🎯 Sprint 1: Polish & UX Improvements

### 1.1 Empty State Improvements ✨

**Problem:** Dashboard showed "—" symbols making the app look broken for new users.

**Solution:**
- Replaced all em dashes with helpful, contextual messages
- Added call-to-action links that navigate to relevant tabs
- Consistent `.empty-state` styling across all components

**Examples:**
- Current Humidity: "No readings yet" → "Log first reading →"
- Days Since String Change: "—" → "Log your first string change" + "Go to 8-Week Tasks →"
- String Life Calculator: "0% life" → "Complete setup to start tracking"
- 24h Change: "—" → "Need 24h of data"

**Impact:** New users immediately understand what actions to take.

---

### 1.2 Guitar Model Identification 🎸

**Problem:** Users didn't know the app was Taylor GS Mini-specific.

**Solution:**
- Added "Configured for Taylor GS Mini Sapele" badge in header
- Model-specific measurements labeled with "GS Mini" indicators
- Action specs (High E: 1.5-2mm, Low E: 2-2.5mm) clearly marked
- 23.5" scale length references labeled throughout

**Impact:** Clear communication that specs are model-specific.

---

### 1.3 Contextual Humidity Reference 💧

**Problem:** Humidity thresholds only visible on Dashboard tab.

**Solution:**
- Visual threshold legend on Humidity Log tab:
  - 45-50% Target (green)
  - 40-55% Safe (blue)
  - <40% Low (yellow)
  - \>55% High (red)
- Real-time input validation with color-coded borders
- Visual feedback doesn't block form submission

**Impact:** Users always know if their readings are concerning.

---

## 🚀 Sprint 2: First-Time User Onboarding

### 2.1 Onboarding Wizard 🪄

**Problem:** New users saw empty dashboard with no way to seed initial data.

**Solution:**
- 4-step wizard appears automatically on first visit
- Never repeats after completion or skip
- Mobile-responsive with smooth animations

**Steps:**
1. **Welcome** - Value proposition and setup preview
2. **String Change Date** - Date picker with "I Don't Remember" option
3. **Playing Frequency** - 4 options mapped to hours/week:
   - Daily: 7 hrs/week
   - Few times/week: 4 hrs/week
   - Weekly: 2.5 hrs/week (default)
   - Occasionally: 1 hr/week
4. **Hygrometer Check** - Yes/No with equipment recommendation

**Data Collection:**
- Seeds string change task (8w-8) with lastCompleted date
- Stores playingFrequency and playingHoursPerWeek
- Stores hasHygrometer flag
- Sets onboardingComplete to prevent repeat

**Impact:**
- Dashboard immediately shows relevant data
- String Life Calculator activated with user's actual data
- Empty states disappear, replaced with meaningful information
- Header updates with user's playing schedule

**UI/UX:**
- Step indicator dots (active/completed states)
- Skip option on every step
- Back/Next navigation
- Success message: "Setup Complete! Welcome!"

---

## 📊 Sprint 3: Data Tracking Enhancements

### 3.1 Playing Session Logging ⏱️

**Problem:** String Life Calculator used hardcoded 2.5 hrs/week assumption.

**Solution:**
- "Just Played" button now shows duration picker
- 4 quick options: 15min, 30min, 1hr, 2hr+
- Sessions stored with timestamp and duration
- Rolling 2-week average (requires 3+ sessions)
- Dashboard displays "This week: X hrs"

**Calculations:**
- Average calculated from last 14 days of sessions
- Fallback to onboarding/default for <3 sessions
- Header subtitle updates with calculated average

**Impact:**
- String Life Calculator uses actual playing habits
- Users see "Based on X hrs/week (your average)"
- Accurate maintenance schedule recommendations

**localStorage:**
- `playingSessions`: Array of {timestamp, duration}
- `playingHoursPerWeek`: Updated dynamically

---

### 3.2 String Change History 📜

**Problem:** Only tracked current counter, no historical record.

**Solution:**
- Brand prompt modal after completing string change task
- Optional brand input (e.g., "D'Addario EJ16", "Elixir Nanoweb")
- History table in Export & Settings
- Calculate average string life from 2+ changes

**History Display:**
- Average string life badge (e.g., "52 days")
- Sortable table: Date | Brand | Days Used
- Days automatically calculated between consecutive changes
- Empty state for new users

**Example:**
```
Average String Life: 52 days

Jan 3, 2026   | D'Addario EJ16  | 45 days
Nov 19, 2025  | D'Addario EJ16  | 58 days
Sep 22, 2025  | Elixir Nanoweb  | —
```

**Impact:**
- Track string brand preferences
- Optimize string change timing based on actual usage
- Identify which brands last longer

**localStorage:**
- `stringChangeHistory`: Array of {date, brand, daysFromPrevious}

---

### 3.3 Humidity Trend Context 📈

**Problem:** 24h Change didn't indicate if rate was concerning.

**Solution:**
- Color-coded severity indicators:
  - **Green** (<5%): Normal variation (safe)
  - **Yellow** (5-10%): Moderate stress (caution)
  - **Red** (>10%): High stress (danger)
- Direction arrows: ↑ rising, ↓ falling
- Info icon (ⓘ) opens educational modal

**Educational Modal Content:**
- Severity scale explanation
- Potential damage from rapid changes:
  - Finish cracking
  - Glue joint stress
  - Bridge movement/lifting
  - Fret sprout
- Prevention tips (keep in case with Humidipak)

**Example Display:**
- Safe: `↑ +2.3%` (green)
- Caution: `↓ -7.5%` (yellow)
- Danger: `↑ +12.1%` (red, bold) + alert

**Impact:**
- Users immediately know if they need to take action
- Educational content explains why rapid changes matter
- Proactive prevention of expensive repairs
